A mutual consent divorce is one of the most efficient and less traumatic ways to end a marriage in India. Under Section 13B of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, both parties can jointly file for divorce if they have been living separately for a period of one year or more.

## Key Requirements

*   **Separation**: The parties must have lived separately for at least one year.
*   **Mutual Agreement**: Both husband and wife must agree that the marriage has broken down irretrievably.
*   **Resolution of Issues**: It is highly recommended that issues like alimony, child custody, and division of assets are settled before filing the petition.

## The Timeline

1.  **First Motion**: The joint petition is filed in the Family Court.
2.  **Waiting Period**: A mandatory waiting period of 6 months (which can sometimes be waived by the court) is required.
3.  **Second Motion**: After the waiting period, parties appear again to confirm their decision.
4.  **Decree of Divorce**: If the court is satisfied, it grants a decree of divorce.
