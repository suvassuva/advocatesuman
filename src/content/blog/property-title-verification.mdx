Buying a home or a piece of land is often the biggest financial commitment someone makes. However, without a thorough title verification, you could be buying into a legal nightmare.

## What is Title Verification?

Title verification involves checking the historical ownership records of a property to ensure that the current seller has the full legal right to sell it and that there are no hidden encumbrances like mortgages, liens, or legal disputes.

## What Documents Should You Check?

1.  **Mother Deed**: Trace the ownership history back at least 30 years.
2.  **Encumbrance Certificate (EC)**: Shows transactions recorded on the property for a specific period.
3.  **Khata Certificate**: Essential for paying property taxes and obtaining building approvals.
4.  **Tax Paid Receipts**: Ensure that all property taxes are up to date.

## The Role of a Legal Expert

A lawyer can conduct a "Search Report" at the Sub-Registrar's office to uncover details that might not be apparent on the face of the documents. This due diligence is the only way to ensure "quiet enjoyment" of your property.
